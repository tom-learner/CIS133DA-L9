# Lesson 9
The computer company client would like you to make a web page that displays some of the offerings they have for individual users and businesses alike using a table to display the data. They'd also like you to create a form that can be submitted to them from potential clientele. This page will serve as a place where users can request an appointment straight from the website, providing information on what services they'd like to inquire about from the company. 

## Project Prep
1. If you haven't done so already, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 

   > **TIP:** Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

   > **TIP:** Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.
4. You will create a table below. Use the correct number of columns and rows to display the following details. Reviewing this information first will help you determine the structure of the table. 
   1. There are seven services offered to both Home & Business users that includes:
      - Offered at a $40 fixed price:
         - Data recovery & transfer
         - Software installation
      - Offered at $60 per hour + hardware costs:
         - Computer repair

## Create the Schedule Page

1. Save a copy of the template.html file to your Lesson 9 Repo folder as: **schedule.html**. Update the comments with your section number and the lesson number.
2. Update the metadata with the following:
    1. Change the title to: `Schedule an Appointment`.
    2. Define the author using your first and last name.
    3. Add a minimum of 5 keywords appropriate for the page content.
    4. Add an appropriate description.
3. Change the link text for the third link to `Book an Appointment`. Apply the **right** class to the list item. Apply the **active** class to the link. 
4. Within the main section, create two second level headings. The first heading should display: `Pricing List` and the second heading should display: `Project Request Form`.
5. Below the Pricing List heading, create a table utilizing the table data provided to you in the project prep. Your table should have 3 columns.
   1. In the first row, create header cells for the appropriate cells to display: `User Type`, `Services` and `Price`.
   2. In the first column, create header cells for the appropriate cells to display: **Home & Business** and **Business**.
   3. Create rows and table cells per row for each necessary entry within the table. When the information is the same between adjacent rows, make sure the cell correctly spans the rows. ***(See example page screenshot below if you need help visualizing how the data should be displayed.)***
6. Below the "Project Request Form" heading, create a paragraph that displays the following information: 
      `Computer Systems Inc. can email or call you today to schedule an appointment or project request. Submit the following form and we will get back to you promptly.`
7. Create a form with the following information:
   1. Apply an attribute to the form that will allow you to test the data when the form is submitted. **TIP:** Review [Lesson 9, Introduction to Forms](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis133da-in-v12/lesson-9-forms-and-tables/introduction-forms/) and the *Postback script* that has been provided to you.
   2. Use the appropriate text input field to allow users to submit the following details: **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email**, and **Phone**.
      - Use a binding method that will provide the most flexibility to style the elements using unique id attributes.
      > **TIP:** You will style your form later in the lesson to make each element display as block elements, therefore you should not add any line breaks to the form unless stated.
   3. Add a paragraph to your form that displays: `How would you prefer we get back to you?`
   4. Create checkable options to allow for one or more choices of contact. Display the following options: **Phone** or **Email**.
      - Use a binding method to make the input child elements of the label. 
   5. Add a paragraph to your form that displays: `Are you requesting for your home or business?`
   6. Create an input field that will allow the user to select one of the following options: **Individual/Home** or **Business**
      - Use a binding method to make the input child elements of the label.
   7. Create a field that will allow the user to type in multiple lines of text. 
      - Use a binding method that will provide the most flexibility to style the elements using unique id attributes.
      - The label should display: **Additional Comments**
   8. Add a line breaks as needed to improve the placement of your form fields.
   9. Create a reset and submit button at the bottom of the form. Display the following text for the appropriate button: **Reset form** and **Submit Form**
